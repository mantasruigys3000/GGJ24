Hi, thanks for taking a look at this little project.

First order of business, lets get some legal stuff out of the way.
I tested a lot of these shaders with the original Earthbound backgrounds,
but since I don't have the legal rights to distribute those I can't put them here.

Luckily they can still be found thanks to our friends at Starmen.net:
https://handbook.fangamer.com/mother2/battlebackgrounds/

Downloading those will allow you to better experiment with the shaders, but you're
free to play around and make your own backgrounds too.

NOTE: For the color cycling shader you need to have a grayscale version of the background that you are
trying to animate. This can be tricky to do, and doesn't always work as expected with the texture you
are trying to play around with. (Feel free to improve.)

How To Use This Package:
========================
What you are trying to do will change a little based off of which shader you are using on the material.
But in general it works like so:
1. Create a material.
2. Select the shader you are looking for in the shader drop down at the dop of the material inspector.
	Most of them are under the shader graphs sub section, the other one is under custom.
3. Choose which backgrounds you want to use. (See special note for the color cycling shader.)
4. Apply it to an image. (Tested with a UI image so that's what it probably works best on.)
5. Mix and match, feel free to create your own backgrounds to plug in and share with me.

Everything in this project is free to use and redistribute. Credit not needed but appreciated.
And please if you modify it in any way, or figure out how to do some of the effects that I missed,
then please let me know. (I won't add it without crediting you. Given how much trouble the oscillation
gave me I'd even consider paying you.)

I also welcome all feedback and improvements.
